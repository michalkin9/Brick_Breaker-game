**How to play**
Click Start Game to begin. Use your mouse to control the sliding platform. The ball will bounce in different directions based on where it hits the platform. Bricks need to be hit one to break.

**About the code**
Our code has the following elements:
- audio - Background and sound music when the ball hits the bricks.
- ball - Which works according to the laws of physics.
- sliding platform - that can be moved left and right and thus control where the ball will fly.
- 3 levels - difficulty level increases
- Bricks - which are arranged differently at each level and when broken there is an animation of bricks breaking.
- menu - You can restart the game at the menu or return to the game if you are disqualified. You will also be shown whether you have been able to pass your highest score.)
